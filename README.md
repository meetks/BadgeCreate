# BadgeCreate
Create Badges for people based on a template. If you arrange a conference and want to dish out badges to people, use this software to create and print badges .

The idea is ODT files are zipped files with "stuff" inside them. So make a template, use this code to change the names, barcodes, picture etc.

Have fun.
